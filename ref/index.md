## New to Flight Rising?

Might write a guide here someday. For now, check out these nifty links:

	A quick-n-dirty overview of the site. Fairly outdated, but covers the basics.

- **[Tiny Little Questions](https://www1.flightrising.com/forums/help/133644)**

	Exactly what it says on the title
	
- [MORE TBA]
